# Codes for Optimal design for matched pair cluster-randomized trials with heterogeneous correlations and costs
This repository contains all the **R codes** used in the article entitled *Optimal Design for Matched Pair Cluster-Randomized Trials with Heterogeneous Correlations and Costs*. The R code filenames are self-explanatory, making it easy to reproduce all the results presented in the paper. The main R script for computing the locally optimal design is **Cost_opt_design_U_L_MPCRT**. The input values are intra-class correlation (rho), matching correlation (rho'), vector of standard deviations (sigma), cost vector of sampling costs (c) and the total budget (T). The output value is the optimal allocation of in the matched pair clusters.
